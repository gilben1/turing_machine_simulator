/*
 * turing_machine simulation program
 *
 * Created by Nicholas Gilbert (nickgilbert2@gmail.com)
 *
 * A program that simulates the running of an infinite tape turing machine
 * based on parsed text files.
 *
 * Input to the tape can be manipulated, and the processing of the input is
 * shown in steps to simulate the position of the tapehead as it processes input
